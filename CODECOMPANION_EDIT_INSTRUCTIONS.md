# CodeCompanion File Edit Instructions

## Overview

To edit files using CodeCompanion, follow these steps and formatting rules:

1. all the notes are present in the "docs" folder.
2. There are specific folders for each topic.
3. There is one readme file in each folder, that readme file only contains important links to the docs from where I am learning and i also should include all the links to the other markdown files in that folder. If the links are not present then please add the links appropriately.
4. add the appropriate notes in the appropriate folder.
5. I alwasy like to write notes in a very consise maner , less works more content style.
