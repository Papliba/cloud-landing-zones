# Tf azapi


advantage:
In tf deployment if the resource was deployed by some other deployment then you will have to import  the resource in the current stack deployment

cons:
you cant see the deployments in azure
tf plan is not better than whatif (strings are not validated like mg id string)
deployments are sometimes inconsistent
